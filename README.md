This master’s thesis aims to design, train, and implement a machine learning (ML) model capable of controlling a reconfigurable metasurface through an FPGA-based hardware controller. The ML model should learn optimal or near-optimal metasurface states to support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tasks such as user direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and beam steering. The final system will integrate software-based ML inference with an FPGA-controlled metasurface for real-time operation.
Reconfigurable metasurfaces (RMS) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are emerging technologies that enable dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves, offering strong potential for future wireless systems with integrated sensing and communication capabilities. A key challenge is to develop fast, efficient, and adaptive control algorithms that can map environmental conditions or system requirements to appropriate metasurface configurations in real time.

In week 1
 I have tried to implement a single neuron inside FPGA nexys A 7.
