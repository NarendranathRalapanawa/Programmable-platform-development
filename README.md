This master’s thesis aims to design, train, and implement a machine learning (ML) model capable of controlling a reconfigurable metasurface through an FPGA-based hardware controller. The ML model should learn optimal or near-optimal metasurface states to support integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) tasks such as user direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimation and beam steering. The final system will integrate software-based ML inference with an FPGA-controlled metasurface for real-time operation.
Reconfigurable metasurfaces (RMS) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) are emerging technologies that enable dynamic manipulation of electromagnetic waves, offering strong potential for future wireless systems with integrated sensing and communication capabilities. A key challenge is to develop fast, efficient, and adaptive control algorithms that can map environmental conditions or system requirements to appropriate metasurface configurations in real time.

Single Neuron Inference on Nexys A7 (hls4ml → Vivado → UART)
1. Overview

This week I implemented a tiny single-neuron neural network in hls4ml, generated RTL with Vivado HLS 2019.2, and integrated it into a Nexys A7-100T FPGA design with a UART interface to a Python script on my PC.

The idea:

Start with a very small NN (effectively a single neuron / tiny dense layer + ReLU).

Use fixed-point representation to make it hardware-friendly.

Run inference on the FPGA.

Send inputs and receive outputs over USB-UART from a Python script.

This README documents where things stand right now.

Single Neuron Inference on Nexys A7 (hls4ml → Vivado → UART)
# Single Neuron on Nexys A7 (hls4ml → Vivado → UART)

## This week I implemented a **single-neuron neural network** on a **Digilent Nexys A7-100T** FPGA and wired it up to a PC over **USB-UART**.

The goal:

- Start with a tiny NN (effectively one neuron + ReLU)
- Run it in **fixed-point** on FPGA (generated by **hls4ml + Vivado HLS**)
- Talk to it from a PC via UART
- Compare the FPGA result with a **software reference model**
